I am doing a school project.
My task is to make the front-end and the back-end of a parking system.
The other students task is to make a functional model with the electronics and esp32+esp32-cam,
it works like this:
IR sensor detects a car closing to the barrier,
then it sends the signal to the esp32-cam,
the cam sends the the signal to the backend for ocr recognition(I have provided the OCR functions to the new folder @ocr/),
then the backend writes the license plate into the db and somehow send the signal to the other esp32 to open the barrier,
.



NEW!!!:
I need you to remove everything that is unnecessary, I need this as simple as possible with the functionality needed.
